Hello! Thank you for visiting Launchbyte Podcast.

When Chris and I first started, we wanted to an outlet to talk about tech. During that time Podcast still wasn't a thing yet. Not as mainstream as it is now. We had to go into an actual recording studio to do a recording. It also gave me my first attempt into recording, making things and getting it out there.

Now there are tons of apps and service out there to help you make podcasts. Heck, you can even record straight from your phone. Anchor is a good example, they had just been acquired by Spotify.

Throughout the years there are lots of on and off in making the shows. It was really hard to stay committed especially with our work plus podcasts was not picking up too. However we did had a lot of fun, especially those crazy [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/LaunchByteTV) and you will never guess that we actually interviewed the [Carousell Founders on our show before](https://afterdark.launchbyte.com/post/41400323182/carousell-the-mobile-marketplace/amp).

Since there are little updates, we have moved all our old shows onto [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/launchbyte-podcast). This makes maintenance easier too. One day, we can share with our kids the funny things we do.

So bye bye for now
