 Hello Everyone! Welcome to the 26th Episode of Nightly. My name is Bosslee and I am your host. Sa wa dee Krup! Learning Thai now and it sure is a very fun language to learn. I think learning a 3rd language is important beside that it is fun, it also helps to expand your opportunities. Also in this episode, I talked about Kim Trump Summit in Singapore. Super proud to be the nation to be hosting this. Finally talking about the buying behavior for large ticket item, do you use desktop or mobile?
