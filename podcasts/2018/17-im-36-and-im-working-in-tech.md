 I'm 36 and I'm working in Tech or at least I think I am working in Tech. Hello everyone! My name is Bosslee and I am your host. Today, I like to talk about age and tech. There is this article on Bloomberg that talks about if you are the ages of 30, you are not welcome to the tech scene in China. Personally I think it is partial true because in Chinese the tech scene is booming, so there are a lot more candidates out there looking for that work. If you are above 30 with a family, honestly it is harder to compete with singles who are younger. However what you bring with you is the experience to help them grow. In this episode, I share my thoughts and I love to hear yours too. **If you are getting this via email, please click on read on web so that you can access the podcast player**
