 Hello everyone! Welcome to the the 13th episode of Nightly! Today I am a bit sad. One of the EDM DJ that I like has pass away. For EDM fans I’m sure you are aware. DJ Avicii was found dead in Oman yesterday (21 April 2018). He produced some of the greatest hits in the EDM scene, one of it is the “Wake me up” which has 100 million played on Spotify but my personal favorite is “The Night” “The Night” is an very interesting and meaningful song. I got to know this song from one of my student when I was doing adjunct lecturing. There are two parts of the lyrics that i especially resonate.   _If you listen to the song on Youtube, the starting message is “... When I died, I want to be remember for the life I lived and not the money I made”_ _The 2nd part will be “__One day you'll leave this world behind, So live a life you will remember."_   I believe Avicii had made it happened. He is truly remembered for his great works. We are not o judged but we all know that when a rising star is popular, he/she faced lots of pressure with fame / power and status. This is a very interesting topic I think most of us are looking for fame / power and status.Honestly, I think everyone wants it, if you are listening and if you tell yourself that you are not into fame, power and status. You might be lying to yourself. The challenge here is how these artists handled the stress of sudden surge of fame. I have not experienced myself but documentaries on Netflix for Beetles / Madonna / Lady GaGa all had a past of taking drugs / excessive drinking to escape the pressure. While we are all trying to chase fame, we have to be ready when it truly comes. The 2nd thing I like to share is the word YOLO. You only live once. We all talk about it, we think about it but some of us never really take action on it, at least from my perspective, And the song is a gentle nudge to it.
