 Hello! Welcome to the 22nd episode of Nightly. My name is Bosslee and I am your host. A year ago, when I started working for the Bossman. I told myslef, a year is the limit. A year has come and pass, I have not left the bossman. What happened? How can I better comprehend my risk on hand? How can I get back into my selling grove? I keep asking myself "if not now, when?" "if not you, how?" But the devil in me, keep saying. What about the risk?
