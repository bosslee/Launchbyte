 Hello everyone! Welcome to the 8th episode of Nightly. This is Bosslee and I am your host. Today, I am going freestyle. No script and I am just going to speak my mind. The main topic in mind is Macbook vs Chromebook. I have been an Apple fan from 2006 till now but that is changing a bit. My Macbook Air ended it's life last year November, after that I decided to take a different approach. I went for a Chromebook because I thought I was coding less and the main purpose of the tool was to surf net. Maybe do some blogging and now I am using the Chromebook for podcasting. So in this episode I shared some of my views on how Chromebook could be the next enterprise machine.Â  Love to hear your views You can find me on @bybosslee on Telegram or you can join this channel https://t.me/launchbyte Thanks for the support
