 Hello everyone! This is Bosslee & Welcome to another episode of Nightly I just realized that when I write on Launchbyte, it actually sends out an email as part of a newsletter. So if you are reading this on a newsletter, please click on "view via browser" Now, today is 01 April 2018, so on top of all fake news on the web. There are also a lot of April Fool Jokes, especially by those from the tech companies. But one thing is interesting, it seems like there are less April fool pranks out there this year. I found two which are quite good.

1. From Google. Google having "Where's Wally" on Google Map. Which is a pretty fun game I must say. I tried it on desktop, but it is much more fun on mobile.
    
2. Another one that I found that is pretty good is from Coca-cola
    

\- Coca-cola's released three new flavors - avocado, sourdough and charcoal - not only do they taste great, they are great for Instagram shots too
