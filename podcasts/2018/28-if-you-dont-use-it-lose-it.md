 Hello everyone! Welcome to the 28th episode of Nightly! My name is bosslee and I am your host. Nightly is a podcast that talks about life after work and it also serves as my audio log. Today I’m talking about a lifestyle I’m pursuing and that’s minimalism. Three things I learn from being an minimalist. 1/ it’s not cheap to be an minimalist because quality shirts that would last a life time cost you. 2/ it does not mean that you buy less and have less. It means only owing stuff that brings value to your life. 3/ Finally, my motto if you don’t use it, lose it. When you have less in your life, everything becomes easier. Easier to let go, easier to move around, easier to change.
