 Hello everyone! My name is Bryan, I am your host and welcome the nightly show! This is where we talk about life about work and how do we get out of the rat race. So I missed recording one episode yesterday, I’m actually quite sad because I missed recording due to work. Haiz.. no choice 拿人钱才，替人消灾. So today is 4th of April, Wednesday. Time flies and it is mid week already. I just have to endure another two more days and it is Friday. I have something interesting to look forward to this Friday, because our CS team will be having a team outing. We will be heading out for a paintball session and I am super excited because this is very first time doing paintball. (You might be wondering how am I going to record my daily podcast on Friday night then? I have a plan, no sure if it would work but the idea is to record while I am on the road to the paintball session) Today, I like to talk about forming habit. If you google you will find that there are many articles talking about how to form a habit. There are many suggestions, ranging from doing things consecutive from 21 days all the way to 66 days. According to Charles Duhigg, author of “The Power of Habit,” habits are not born, but created. Every bad, good or insignificant habit starts with a psychological pattern called a “habit loop.” And the “habit loop” is a 3 part process.

1. A trigger that tells your brain to let a certain behavior unfold
2. The routine itself
3. The reward, or “something that your brain likes that helps it remember

This magic process is suppose to last 66 days and it has to be daily. For example, there was this guy who got to meet the now famous Jerry Seinfeld before he was famous. How do you tell better jokes? Jerry Seinfeld shared that to write better jokes, the way to do it is to write it everyday. You see, daily action builds habits. It gives you practice and will make you an expert in a short time. If you don't break the chain, you'll start to spot opportunities you otherwise wouldn't. Small improvements accumulate into large improvements rapidly, however if you start skipping one day, it makes it easier to skip the other. I myself is trying to build this habit of making a new podcast show everyday, even though I know that no one might be listening. But I listen to it myself, so I can improve. Are you trying to build any habits now? I love to hear your suggestions on how are you building your habits.
