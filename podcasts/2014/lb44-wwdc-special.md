## Shownotes

1. [WWDC](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7msd7oXbRo): The Verge has come up with a 10 minutes video covering all the gist of the keynote.
2. [iOS](http://lifehacker.com/all-the-new-stuff-in-ios-8-1584893352): Lifehacker gives the most concise summary for all the new stuff on iOS 8. I love the new Photos app on iPhone and it does steals away a bit of limelight from Googleplus photos.
3. [Yosemite](http://lifehacker.com/all-the-new-stuff-in-os-x-10-10-yosemite-1584870045): From Lifehacker, everything you need to know about OS X 10.10 “Yosemite”.
