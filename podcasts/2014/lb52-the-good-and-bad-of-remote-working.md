This week we talk about working remotely. What are some the benefits of working remotely? What are some ways to help your team work remotely and remain accountable? Would we recommend working remotely? Also I like to add if you are wondering what is Singlish all about. Here is the [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish).

> ‘Singlish,’ Singapore’s unique brand of colloquial English, is the linguistic product of a society whose official common language is English, but which comprises ethnic Chinese, Malays, and Indians in a ratio of roughly 7:2:1. Borrowing freely from various dialects for its vocabulary, grammatical structures and spoken accent, Singlish has evolved into a creole that often leaves uninitiated outsiders laughing, or reeling from incomprehension.
