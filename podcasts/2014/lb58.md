\[youtube=http://youtu.be/Q2v-WcOVAfg\] Reading is important we all know that, however many of us failed to read at least a book in a year. Why is this so? Simply because the Internet has taken over most of our times. Remember the times when Internet wasn't so prominent, the leisure activities involves much more engagement and interactions. Playing over at the playground, just plain running around with friends, watching some TV and also visiting the library. Furthermore, we are chasing after time now. We like to see results in the shortest possible time. We enjoy online articles because they are shorter and easier to consume. Article like "[14 Things Every Successful Person Has In Common](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/12/17/14-things-every-successful-person-has-in-common/)" in list form is better than reading any successful person's biography that is 2000 pages long. I'm not sharing that online articles are not good. I'm writing one now myself and hopefully you find it meaningful too.  However reading a book is different, **it connects your brain.** When you are reading, you are in **full silence**, giving the book your full attention rather than clicking articles. This silence makes your brain want more, it is clear and focus. You start to see the point of view from the author. Sometimes, reading gives you new found creativity. When reading, you are exploring a different angle to see aching you known. For example, I'm reading Zero to One by Peter Thiel, who would have expected that monopoly should be something a startup aim for. I personally also thought that the bigger the market, the better is it. I like to end this with a quote.
