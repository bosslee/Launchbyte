This week Chris and I discuss about startup game plan. It is not a 20 pages kind of business plan but rather a single page plan that sets the direction and vision of the company. This game plan we believe is the building block of building a company. You may have a great idea but with execution done wrong. Everything would go to waste. But can a game plan guarantee the success of your startup? The answer is no but it can certainly help you is building your roadmap. What are the things needed in a game plan?

- Vision: To be the largest social network for pets?
- Financial Projections: To prepare for 18 months or have a 5 year plan?
- Goals: Different goals at different stages?
- Resources: Your team? money? and connections?
- Time frames: Build a company to sell, exit in 3 years? or to build a one hundred years company like Evernote?
- Stages of a Start up: Product building stage? Sales stage? or Growth stage? Different tasks at different stages

## Useful Resources For Building Game Plan

### Vision

> The vision for a company must be robust for years at a time. Technologies, social networks, trends, all come and go, and a company must stay relevant regardless. via [Link](http://insideintercom.io/why-startups-need-a-strong-vision/)

Example: “To organize the world‘s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” — Google

### Financial Projections

> The first assumption that you need to understand is that your sales projections are wrong and they always will be! via Quora

### Goals

> The data you collect may be helpful at some point; but if you can’t cut out the noise, you’ll get buried. That’s why you should think about a single metric that’s most important for the stage of your company’s development, a single number that you want the entire company to focus on and improve upon. I call it the One Metric That Matters. via [How to Use a Single Metric to Run Your Startup](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/single-startup-metric/)

### Resources

> One of the hardest truths about entrepreneurship is that no one will ever care as much about your idea as you do. You know there is a market opportunity and you know you have a killer product, but it is possible that you aren’t telling your story in a compelling way. Hughes recommends surveying your friends and customers to make sure there is consistency is how people see your company. via [How to build your ‘A-Team’](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/startup-hiring-how-to-build-your-a-team/)

### Stages Of Startup

> At every stage of the startup, there are a set of actions that are “right” for the startup, in that they maximize return on time, money, and effort. A lean/bootstrapped entrepreneur ignores all else.
