This is the last episode of the Bootstrappers series. Previously, we talked to Ian Tay from Pixaroll about finding users who would pay for your product, Kyaw Lin Oo from EventNook about working on side projects to boost your confidence, and Jerome Chan from Ideas Incubator and Petfie about following your heart. Last but not least, letâ€™s talk about the money. Bootstrapping is particularly difficult because founders need to survive on the little money that they have. For Vincent Teo and Ang Qian Ling, who used to work in advertising firms, having a budget is really important, especially when they have few resources. Here, e27 chats them up about being selective when it comes to new ideas, and the constant wonder if they could grow any faster if they have more money.
