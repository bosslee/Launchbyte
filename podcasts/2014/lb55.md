In this show we chat about originality, copy cats and some tips to differentiate yourself. If you have any feedback please tweet at us [@launchbyte](https://twitter.com/launchbyte "@launchbyte"), email us at hi@launchbyte.com or ask us anything [here](https://launchbyte.com/ask "ask us anything"). We would love to hear your opinions about what we talk about and if you have an interesting topic you want us to discuss. We started talking about originality because of this particular incident. Derek Low is traveler & Engineer. He was the guy who created the Ridiculously Automated Dorm during his freshman years in Berkeley. \[youtube=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x1GkgbVP1I\] Recently he wrote an article sharing his experience flying in the [first class suite on SIA which cost him S$23000](http://dereklow.co/what-its-like-to-fly-the-23000-singapore-airlines-suites-class/) if he had not exchanged it with his miles. There were lots of amazing photos and it was a pretty detail write up. It also makes me wonder when will I collect enough miles to make this flight. Anyway, this article was spreading like wild fire until the redactors found out that [Derek apparently plagiarised parts of his review from various sources and the original writers have sniffed him out for it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2huw34/what_its_like_to_fly_the_23000_singapore_airlines/). So what do you think? Steve Job onces quoted 'Good artists copy; great artists steal' \[youtube=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW0DUg63lqU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW0DUg63lqU)\] **Was Derek wrong? Personally, I think so. He should have credited the source of the photos. But lets think about? Is it really hard to be original now?**

Kirby Ferguson even gave a TED talk on it. \[ted id=1535\] Chris came up with 3 kind of situation of copying and we discuss deeply in the podcast.

- Copying: Taking an idea and applying it as part of your solution.
- Cloning: Taking an idea and not changing it significantly
- Stealing: Taking an idea and claiming it as your own without crediting the source

We end this show notes with another food for thought

\> “Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is non-existent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: “It’s not where you take things from - it’s where you take them to." via \[Link\]([http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/131591-nothing-is-original-steal-from-anywhere-that-resonates-with-inspiration](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/131591-nothing-is-original-steal-from-anywhere-that-resonates-with-inspiration))
