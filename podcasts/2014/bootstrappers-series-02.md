Last week, we announced that e27 has entered the audio space with our very first podcast series Bootstrappers. We loved our chat with Ian Tay, Co-founder, Pixaroll! To recap, he spoke about how entrepreneurs who are on the path of self-funding should find a market and understand how to make money before anything else. This week, we are rolling up our sleeves with Kyaw Lin Oo, a Burmese entrepreneur in Singapore who has founded [EventNook](http://www.eventnook.com). Here he talks about the value of friendship when working alone, and importance of side projects.
