## About Tomboy Tarts

Tomboy Tarts is a lifestyle brand helmed by two co-owners; [Raven Lim](https://twitter.com/postscripted) and [Persis Shanker](https://twitter.com/persisshanker).

## Why Tomboy?

> Classic tomboy greats like Katherine Hepburn, Coco Chanel, Marlene Dietrich and Amelia Earhart embodied the true meaning of what being a tomboy was. They were women who oozed a free spirit with confidence and style. Women who straddled both their feminine and masculine sides with ease. Women who embraced their unique style with courage and grace without having to conform to society’s stereotypes of women. These were the true tomboys; the classy, sexy ladies who were still ‘bad ass’ enough to break some rules while maintaining their independance. It’s these qualities that the team of Tomboy Tarts embraces and celebrates and it is their desire to share it with the rest of the world.
