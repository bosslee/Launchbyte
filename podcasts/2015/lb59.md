![](/static/img/tumblr_ma9qbzxwJd1qliy27o1_500.gif) It's been a year since we did up our podcast and we are finally back. This is the start of Launchbyte 3rd series. The format is once again change :P like our lives always do. This time round we are doing like a talk show. We dived into a topic and we go deep. This time, we love you to join us too. (Check out the venue below) This week we talk about why you might not need an app for your business. There are so many apps out there, by introducing another app, does it make any more sense to your business? Also we look at [#pap4sg](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/peoples-action-party-launches-new-mobile-app-during-election-season), a new app by the People's Action Party to engage the public during the election period. Is it worth it? Maybe they could have just use Facebook? We love to hear your comments. _Podcast Location_ _Blk 79 Ayer Rajah Crescent _ _#02-23 S(139955)_ _Friday 9am. _ We talk tech in asia.
