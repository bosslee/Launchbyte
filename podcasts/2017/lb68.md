Happy New Year everyone! How was the New Year celebration for you all? For me, it's more of a stay at home "family time". It's been a long time since Chris and I do up a show. So since we are free, we decided to a show together. The topic of the show is "Past, Present, Future". We talk about our past, the present and how we see the future. Here are a list of topics that we talked about.

1. Find out what crazy decision I made in 30 Dec 2016 and what I'm looking to do in the coming year
2. Find out what is Chris's goal for Sphere in this brand new year
3. Chris and I predict tech trends
    1. Live streaming
    2. AR/VR
    3. Chatbots
    4. Insurance Tech
4. [Arc Board EV](http://www.arcboardsev.com): Chris got a Arc Board EV, produced by a group of Singapore. It is a kickstarter project. And you got to give them a hand because they are not doing this full time. The maple wood material is amazing.

Thanks for supporting us all these while, we love you guys. sorry the sound of my fan Bryan :)
