Chris and I get back to podcasting. There is a bigger world outside tech and we want to talk about it. Forgive me for my metallic sound, I'm looking to get a better mic soon. If you have an introduction, do drop us an email. This week we talked about

- how running is not helping you lost weight
- how nanyang coffee beans can also be used for cold brew
