Welcome to another Episode of Launchbyte. I am your host [Chris Cai](https://twitter.com/AnttyC) and with me with my regular cohost [Bryan Lee](https://twitter.com/leetucksing?). This is a podcast where we talk about entrepreneurship in Singapore and other random things that interest us. In this show we talk about the big F word. **Failure**. As a start up, especially in Singapore, we tend to shy away from the topic of Failure. How should we deal with it. Reference: [Why Acceptance of Failure is Critical to Startup Success](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-acceptance-of-failure-is-critical-to-startup-success-335dde15b0aa#.8ofv2pl67) Pick of the week!
