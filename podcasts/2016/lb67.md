This week Chris and I talk about SaaS. We take reference from this [article](https://medium.com/product-people/saas-is-ripe-for-disruption-56429324a0ed#.7x1xlmt6b) here about the opportunity of Sass and the possibility in the change in business model for Saas. We shared our views on the following:

- The return to desktop apps
- Self-hosted cloud applications
- Pay once web apps
- All-in-one
- Micro SaaS built on bigger platforms

## Pick of the week

[Bryan](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c-s.w4002-14453506927.31.fytMP7&id=43762218484): A wooden desktop stationery rack from Taobao. Cheap and good. Kinda of copy Muji in design, but it works great. [Chris](https://www.facebook.com/ArcBoardsEV/): If you support local, this is a project that you should be supporting too. These guys from Arc Boards EV are building the next cool thing that you can use for city commute. The best part is that they are using their prototype to catch pokemons now.
