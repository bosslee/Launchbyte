## What is Freeletics?

It is a type of bodyweight fitness. Freeletics contains three types of training: Workouts, Exercises and Runs.The combination of these three types of training is ideal for maximum progress. The high intensity allows for impressive results despite significantly reduced workout times. So you have no excuse to say that you have not time to exercise because some of these training takes between 15mins to 30mins only. Most importantly, you can do it anywhere without equipments. \*You get the best result when training in a group and it helps to motivate one and another. \*
