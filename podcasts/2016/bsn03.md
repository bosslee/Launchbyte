https://www.instagram.com/p/BWqm597FOqn/?taken-by=ichigothen Once upon a time, if men wanted to compete in a physique competition there was only one category: bodybuilding. The same was true for women. These days, women can compete in bikini, figure, fitness, physique, and bodybuilding. The posing and related requirements are different for each, but the main difference is obvious: muscular size. This week on Becoming Stronger, we talk about Bodybuilding. It is an honour to have Carol with us. She shares with us her journey on bodybuilding, what got her started and her thoughts on female bodybuilding.
