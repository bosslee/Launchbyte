This week, let's talk about Aerial Yoga with Nicole. She is a very charming lady and this is how she describe herself, "_I am living life with a relentless thirst. I am an aerialist, a yogi, a pole dancer and everything in between. I love being in the air. I relish extreme sports and live vivaciously through travel._" So who else better than an aerialist to share about Aerial Yoga? :P ![Nicole Lee](/static/img/nicole_lee.jpg)
