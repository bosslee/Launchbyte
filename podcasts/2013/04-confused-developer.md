## Google Reader dead, really?

Here are some of the alternatives we are using

1. [feedly](http://cloud.feedly.com/)
2. [digg reader](http://digg.com/login)

But if you are the kind of guy, who hates being tied to a particular platform - this is for you. [Go Read](http://www.goread.io/) works and act exactly like Google Reader yet you own all the data.
