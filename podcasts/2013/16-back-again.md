Hey, we are back from a long break. We apologized once again. I was in SV and Chris is now running his very own startup! In this episode, here my experience in SV and some of Chris adventure of fund raising in Singapore. He is planning to do more sharing of his experience on our [blog](http://afterdark.launchbyte.com) too.

## Show notes for this week!

1. The SV Hardware Movement - [Photos](http://www.flickr.com/short_urls.gne?photoset=aHsjLjAQPB) Taken at SF TechShop. So what is a [TechShop](http://www.techshop.ws/press_releases.html?&action=detail&press_release_id=54) - it is a a membership-based, do-it-yourself (DIY) creative workshop.
2. [Fitness Band War](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/10/17/fitness-band-wars-nike-fuelband-se-vs-fitbit-force-vs-jawbone-up/)!
3. Should I get iPad Air or [iPad mini retina](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/22/4865784/ipad-mini-with-retina-display-2013-announcement)?
4. iOS7 adoption rate. As of [18 Oct 2013](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/10/17/fitness-band-wars-nike-fuelband-se-vs-fitbit-force-vs-jawbone-up/), it is 73%. Should you create an app for just iOS7 users or do you plan to support the older versions?
