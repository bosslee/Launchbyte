This is a super short week! So if you have taken 3 days of leave starting last friday, you would be enjoying a super long 10 days of holiday. But… that’s usually for those working in the corporate work. In the startup world, you are always working/selling. We apologised for the late entry the week. Some technical issues came up and we doing our podcast this week at [NUS Radio Pulze](http://www.radiopulze.com/) Thank you so much! Also another great news, our podcast is now on [iTunes!](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/podcast/launchbyte/id680169335) so please do support us and give us feedback. I also shared a post on how I build the launchbyte [podcasting service](http://bosslee.co/2013/07/28/podcasting-with-dropbox-and-jekyll/)

## So this week in news

- [Smart vibrator Vibease debuts on Indiegogo, new spokesperson is creator of contentious Valley reality TV show](http://sgentrepreneurs.com/2013/07/30/vibease/) Lets talk about tech and sex!
- [Singapore better than United States for hardware makers](http://sgentrepreneurs.com/2013/07/29/singapore-a-better-than-silicon-valley-for-hardware-makers-bunnie-huang/) hardware is coming back!

## Topic of the week - CTO Really?

Startup founders, do we really need a CTO? or are you just looking for a developer? Could CTO be just a nicer name that you have your friend who knows tech work for you “free”?

## App of the week - [DOTs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dots-a-game-about-connecting/id632285588?mt=8)

This app is driving me crazy, it’s a free game and it’s really really addictive. Great if you are puzzles. Try beating yourself, or us. We have a high score _as of writing_ 230.
