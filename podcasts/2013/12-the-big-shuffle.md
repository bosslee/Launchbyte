1. Researchers have proved that dropbox can be hacked! Despite Dropbox’s Encryption and 2 factor authentication security measures, 2 researchers have reverse engineered and hacked Dropbox. Dropbox responded by saying “We appreciate the contributions of these researchers and everyone who helps keep Dropbox safe. However, we believe this research does not present a vulnerability in the Dropbox client. In the case outlined here, the user’s computer would first need to have been compromised in such a way that it would leave the entire computer, not just the user’s Dropbox, open to attacks across the board.” [http://www.businessinsider.com/researchers-prove-dropbox-can-be-hacked-2013-8](http://www.businessinsider.com/researchers-prove-dropbox-can-be-hacked-2013-8)
