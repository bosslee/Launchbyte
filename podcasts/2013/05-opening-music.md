# opening music

A big thank you to all the staff from Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC). Bryan’s had to go for her Cataract ops, in this podcast he share how he survived the week, handling the business operations, looking after his and worrying about the medical costs.

## follow-up

what’s a good web development language for starter? We discussed about nodejs and rails. But Bryan ended up with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). Another awesome framework, that is simple and quick, kinda of an equivalent of [express.js](http://expressjs.com/). Chris shared about his gripe with web apps.

## startup gossip

Some useful expenses app discussed

## ios

why **iOS** is the best for starter to get into mobile development and programming

1. ignore frontend - with Storyboards
2. ignore backend - with Parse
3. focus on code - learn from many tutorials
4. impress girls - very much possible
5. an app in 30days - checked
6. iOS Libraries - steal from othe[rs](http://cocoapods.org/)

and on the topic of iOS, Chris shared his thoughts about the common mistake starter make in development. [topic in discussion-Mistakes Clients make when building their app](http://sgentrepreneurs.com/2013/07/05/the-top-mistakes-clients-make-when-building-their-app/)
