This week we add a new section on bitcoins! We will be doing a series on it weekly so if you are into bitcoins, we love to discuss. Also how can we not talk of our local instagram superstar [@curiousmarcus](http://curiousmarcus.com/) when we discuss about the new instagram direct. Listen to what we have to say about Marcus :P
