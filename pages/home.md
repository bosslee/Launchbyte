# Welcome

Yes this site is plain on purpose.

## What is this site about?

Launchbyte used to be a podcast site. You can find more about it [here](/about).

After a long hiatus, decided to make it something useful again. I will be using it to share the every tech stuff that I have learn. You will find useful stuff like: 

- how to build your own website or even e-commerce sites
- how to write your own automation scripts at work. No more repetition work.
- what are the latest no-code tools, you can use to help with your workflow.


## What makes you the person to talk about it?

I graduated from NUS Business School but I fell in love with Tech and start exploration on my own. I learn a lot from open source materials and online courses. While no certifications are given from self-learning, these skill sets help me both personally and professionally. 

Currently, I am a Technical Program Manager with Lazada Group

I am still learning and I believe the best way to learn is to teach.

## Who is this site for?

- You are looking for quick hacks to improve your workflow
- You are looking to build your own thing online

## Finding me elsewhere?
