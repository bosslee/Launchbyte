# Welcome

Yes this site is plain on purpose.

## What is this site about?

Launchbyte used to be a podcast site. You can find more about it [here](/about).

After a long hiatus, decided to make it something useful again. Currently the topic on this site is about e-commerce. 

## What makes you the person to talk about it?

I been working in a local ecommerce marketplace for sometime and I learn a few things. **Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer**.

These are **NOT** secrets that I am sharing. These are open information which you can find online but because there are so many clutter out there, you might have missed out the important information.

I hope this can be useful for businesses that are moving online especially during this Covid19 period. 

## Who is this site for?

* if you are starting out in e-commerce
* if you are a business affect by the Covid19 situation and looking to move your business online.
* if you are into the latest trend in e-commerce

## Finding me elsewhere?
